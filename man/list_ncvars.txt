SYNOPSIS

contain only character arrays are skipped.

OPTIONS
-------
_INPUT_NML_::
A Fortran namelist passed in from stdin with the name "input", with the variables:

[cols="1,1"]

| var0d
| LOGICAL

| var1d
| LOGICAL

| var2d

| var4d
| LOGICAL
|===

EXAMPLE
-------
Print all static, 1-d variables in netCDF file "file.nc"

[verse]
list_ncvars <<EOF
 &input
   filename = 'file.nc',
   list_static = .true.,
   list_nonstatic = .false.,
   var0d = .false.,
